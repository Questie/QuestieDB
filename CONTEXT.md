# QuestieDB

The database Questie consumes. Stores entity data as WoW addon TOC metadata, readable at
runtime with no file I/O, and owns the offline generator that produces it.

QuestieDB is a separate project from Questie, with its own release cycle and consumers.
Its domain is nonetheless *Questie's data model* — the schema, including Questie-specific
fields, is what QuestieDB stores and serves.

## Language

### Storage

**TOC metadata store**:
Addon `.toc` metadata used as string-backed storage for lazy entity field access.
_Avoid_: TOC DB, metadata DB, file I/O replacement

**Metadata field**:
One value addressed by a key inside the TOC metadata store. Entity storage uses ID headers,
Scalar rows, and individual table fields.
_Avoid_: TOC row, file record

**Scalar row**:
The stored scalar values for one entity, together with its Presence mask. Baked mode decodes it
on the entity's first field read.
_Avoid_: Metadata row, object, scalar column

**Presence mask**:
The bitmask in a Scalar row that records which table fields have stored values.
_Avoid_: Table index, field map

**Localization block**:
The compressed field columns for one locale and entity type, aligned with that type's base ID
list. A non-English client retains its active Localization blocks for the session.
_Avoid_: Translation blob, locale row, l10n page

**Chunked metadata value**:
A long Metadata field split into numbered parts and reassembled before decoding. Parts
never begin or end with client-trimmable bytes — the client strips edge whitespace from
metadata values (measured; see `docs/client-metadata-probes.md`).
_Avoid_: Combined parts, split value

**Raw coordinate**:
An authored or Derived Pass spawn/waypoint coordinate preserved without legacy compiler-grid
quantization in both Source and Baked mode (ADR 0006).
_Avoid_: Unquantized coordinate, full-precision coordinate

**Generation**:
The offline process that turns raw entity data plus Static Corrections into a TOC metadata store.
_Avoid_: Compilation, build, cooking

**Derived Pass**:
A deterministic transform over corrected entity data, run before storage, in both Generation
and Source mode. Distinct from a Correction, which is data (`id` to field index to value) — a
Derived Pass is code, and may read one entity type while writing another. Reproduces a
transform Questie applies between corrections and compilation, so that reads match the
database a player actually receives (ADR 0004).
_Avoid_: Preprocess, precompile, postprocess, pipeline stage

**Support data**:
Game reference data consumed as whole tables rather than through the TOC metadata store —
zone mappings, quest XP, drop tables, faction templates. Shipped as plain Lua files.
_Avoid_: Auxiliary data, helper data, lookup data

**Source mode**:
The runtime state where entity reads resolve from raw entity data with all Corrections
applied live, because no generated TOC metadata store is present.
_Avoid_: Dev mode, debug mode, uncompiled

**Baked mode**:
The runtime state where entity reads resolve from a generated TOC metadata store, with
Static Corrections already folded in.
_Avoid_: Release mode, compiled mode, production

### Corrections

**Correction**:
A change to entity data, expressed as entity ID to field index to value.
_Avoid_: Fix, patch, workaround, override

**Static Correction**:
A Correction folded into the TOC metadata store during Generation. Never shipped to end users.
_Avoid_: Compile-time correction, baked correction

**Dynamic Correction**:
A Correction applied at query time. QuestieDB-owned Dynamic Corrections may depend only on
provider-owned data or generic character/game facts QuestieDB determines itself: class, race,
faction, expansion, and season. A consumer registers its own Dynamic Corrections for
consumer-owned runtime state or policy.
_Avoid_: Runtime correction, conditional fix

**Gated Dynamic set**:
A group of Dynamic Correction functions registered only while its runtime condition holds.
SoD and Titan Reforged use file-level season gates.
_Avoid_: Conditional registration, feature flag

**Correction Overlay**:
The composed query-time layer of Dynamic Corrections that entity reads resolve through.
_Avoid_: Runtime override, override table, merged correction

### Localization

**Generated locale**:
A non-English locale included in Generation and represented by Base translation blocks in a Baked
artifact. The generated inventory contains the nine official non-English client locales.
_Avoid_: Supported locale (Dynamic translations also support Custom locales)

**Custom locale**:
A non-English locale outside the Generated locale inventory. It has no Base translation block and
receives entity translations only from Dynamic Translation Corrections.
_Avoid_: Unsupported locale

**Base translation**:
An authored non-English value for a translatable entity field. Static Translation Corrections
are folded into Base translations during Generation.
_Avoid_: Lookup value, localized correction

**Static Translation Correction**:
A change to a Base translation folded into Localization blocks during Generation.
_Avoid_: Localization override, lookup override

**Dynamic Translation Correction**:
A locale-aware change to a translation selected at query time, optionally gated by generic
character or game facts such as expansion and season. Its locale may be generated or custom,
but must be a non-empty string other than `enUS`. It cannot create an entity.
_Avoid_: Localized entity correction, runtime translation override

### Access

**Entity global**:
A public table exposing one entity database, such as quests or NPCs.
_Avoid_: Namespace, module object

**Named getter**:
A function on an Entity global returning one field by its canonical field name.
_Avoid_: Accessor, field helper

**Generic getter**:
A function on an Entity global returning one field by positional field index.
_Avoid_: Index getter, raw getter

**Decoded field cache**:
The runtime cache behind the getters. Baked mode caches a decoded Scalar row per touched
entity; table fields cache a Producer.
_Avoid_: Getter cache, Lua cache

**Producer**:
The cached mechanism a table read executes to return a fresh Caller-owned value. Baked
producers retain CBOR bytes; Source, Correction Overlay, and translated values retain a value
to copy.
_Avoid_: Factory, thunk, generator (collides with the offline Generation vocabulary)

**Caller-owned value**:
Every table returned from an entity read is a fresh, mutable, deeply independent copy the
caller owns — Questie's original per-call semantics (ADR 0003 D10, revised). `table.freeze`
applies only to QuestieDB-internal shared structures.
_Avoid_: Frozen value (the retired original contract), shared value, borrowed table

**Composed enumeration**:
`GetAllIds` and `Exists` answering over the union of the backend's entities and those the
Correction Overlay adds — an added entity is readable, enumerable, and exists, all three.
_Avoid_: Merged id list, extended pointers

**l10n overlay**:
The optional localization layer that resolves generated Base translations and Dynamic Translation
Corrections for the active non-English locale, including custom locales with registered Dynamic
slots. Locale-first read precedence is defined by ADR 0013.
_Avoid_: Localization DB, translation patch

**Name index**:
The per-type reverse of the `name` getter — current composed name to ascending entity ids —
built lazily from reads, dropped with the Decoded field cache and rebuilt rather than patched
(ADR 0008). Exists for a consumer handed a name and no id, such as a hovered world object.
_Avoid_: Reverse lookup, name map, objectNameLookup

### Verification

**Equivalence sweep**:
The gate proving Source and Baked modes read identically for every id × field across every
public read form, ending in a Self-proof.
_Avoid_: Parity test, mode test

**Self-proof**:
A gate's built-in demonstration that it fails when it should — an injected divergence or
corrupted byte that must be detected exactly once. A gate without one is decoration.
_Avoid_: Sanity check, canary

**Reconstruction gate**:
`reconstruct.lua` — re-derives every data directive with the current generator and
compares against the artifact as exact bytes, localizing mismatches to named keys.
_Avoid_: Round-trip test (that is `verify.lua`, which decodes)

**Golden snapshot**:
The committed per-id hashes of accepted composed reads (`tools/differential/golden/`),
checked per flavor in CI. The frozen mirror that catches defects where generator and
source mode agree with each other while both diverge from upstream — the class the
retired `-pi` sibling's independence caught during the merge program.
_Avoid_: Baseline (that word belongs to the validators), reference dump

**Compiler comparison adapter**:
The migration-only projection that converts QuestieDB base coordinates to Questie's legacy
12-bit read values immediately before the compiler differential. It never runs in Generation
or runtime reads and retires with the compiler oracle (ADR 0006).
_Avoid_: Production quantizer, compatibility mode

**Persona**:
The emulator's mocked client identity — faction, race, class, season — letting gated and
faction-differentiated correction branches execute offline.
_Avoid_: Test profile, mock player

## Boundary with Questie

**QuestieDB owns what is true about game entities. Questie owns what to do with that truth.**

A Correction fixes what is true — a wrong coordinate, a missing prerequisite. QuestieDB may
select a Dynamic Correction only from provider-owned data or generic character/game facts it
determines itself: class, race, faction, expansion, and season. A Correction selected or
constructed from consumer-owned runtime state or policy belongs to that consumer.

Display suppression, consumer phase/settings state, projections and caches, and asynchronous
repair of consumer data therefore remain consumer-owned. A quest that is duplicate or
unobtainable still exists, and another consumer may legitimately want it.

Questie is a consumer. Storage vocabulary stops here — Questie has no terms for Metadata
fields, Chunked metadata values, or Generation.

Questie's **Runtime Override** is retired in favour of **Correction Overlay**; its former
definition referred to reading compiled data, and compilation no longer exists.
