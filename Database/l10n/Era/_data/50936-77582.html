You will hunt and slay many beasts in service to the Alliance, but even in battle you must respect your foe.

My previous apprentice used a mystical rune to augment her skills, but foolishly attempted to practice on the largest of the spiders in the cave to the north, a creature we have named Githyiss the Vile. Her disrespect led to her demise.

Slay Githyiss - but do not underestimate its strength.‡Um caçador tira força da conexão e respeito que tem com todas as criaturas, não apenas com seus ajudantes. Você vai caçar e matar vários animais a serviço da Aliança, mas, mesmo em batalha, é preciso respeitar o inimigo.

Minha aprendiz anterior usava uma runa mística para aumentar seus poderes, mas, tolamente, tentou praticar na maior das aranhas da caverna do norte, uma criatura a quem demos o nome de Githyiss, a Torpe. Esse desrespeito levou à sua morte.

Mate Githyiss, mas não subestime a força dela.‡Охотники черпают силу в близости и уважении ко всем живым созданиям, а не только к своим питомцам. На службе у Альянса ты убьешь не одного зверя, но даже в бою надо уважать врага.

Моя предыдущая ученица усиливала свои способности чародейской руной, но самонадеянно решила потренироваться на Гитьис Зловещей – самой крупной паучихе из пещеры на севере. Неуважение к врагу ее погубило.

Убей Гитьис – но не вздумай недооценивать ее силу.‡Ein Jäger zieht seine Kraft nicht nur aus seinen Begleitern, sondern aus der Verbindung mit allen Wesen und dem Respekt für sie. Ihr werdet viele Tiere im Dienst für die Allianz jagen und erlegen, aber selbst im Kampf müsst Ihr Euren Gegner respektieren.

Mein letzter Lehrling nutzte eine mystische Rune, um ihre Fähigkeiten zu verstärken, aber leichtsinnigerweise wollte sie sie gleich an der größten Spinne der Höhle im Norden ausprobieren: einer Kreatur, die wir Githyiss die Üble nennen. Ihre Respektlosigkeit hatte ihr Ableben zur Folge.
