Glad to have you back, |name|.

The latest object of my desire is an artifact known as the Eye of Bhossca . My sources tell me the eye is somewhere within the Scarlet Monastery. As with Shadowfang Keep, you must infiltrate the monastery alone.

Хорошо, что ты |вернулся/вернулась|, |имя|.

На этот раз мне нужен артефакт, известный как глаз Бхосски. Согласно моим источникам, он находится где-то в монастыре Алого ордена. Как и тогда, в крепости Темного Клыка, тебе нужно проникнуть в монастырь в одиночку.

Возможно, тебе следует сначала раздобыть маскировку – так будет несколько проще перемещаться в самом монастыре. Наверняка на его территории что-нибудь найдется.

Принеси артефакт сюда и получишь награду так же, как раньше.

C‡|Eine Notiz liegt in der Truhe.|

Ich bin froh, dass Ihr zurück seid, |Name|.

Das neueste Objekt meines Begehrens ist ein Artefakt, das als das Auge von Bhossca bekannt ist. Meine Quellen deuten darauf hin, dass das Auge irgendwo im Scharlachroten Kloster verborgen liegt. Wie bei Burg Shadowfang müsst Ihr Euch auch alleine in das Kloster schleichen.

Möglicherweise müsst Ihr Euch eine Verkleidung suchen, bevor Ihr hineingeht. Damit kommt Ihr Euch etwas einfacher bewegen. Ich bin sicher, Ihr könnt etwas auf dem Klostergelände finden.

Bringt das Auge hierher und Eure Bezahlung wird wie gewohnt geliefert.

В последний раз ее видели на северо-востоке от лагеря Кэгг. Может, у нее гнездо где-то рядом?

Выманивать такую птаху надо на живца. Я одолжу тебе клетку, в которую можно поймать такую приманку. Мелких зверьков в Бесплодных землях почти нет, так что искать придется где-нибудь еще.

Если справишься, забери у Гаррик перо.

Er wurde zuletzt nordöstlich von Camp Cagg gesehen. Vielleicht ist sein Nest irgendwo in der Nähe?

Ihr werdet Lebendköder brauchen, wenn Ihr ihn hervorlocken wollt. Ich werde Euch einen Käfig leihen, um welchen zu fangen. Kleine Wildtiere sind im Ödland selten, ihr werdet Euren Köder also anderswo suchen müssen.
