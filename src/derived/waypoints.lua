-- Derived Pass: waypoint simplification, reproducing `QuestieCorrections:PreCompile` and
-- `QuestieCorrections:OptimizeWaypoints` (Questie/Database/Corrections/QuestieCorrections.lua).
--
-- Upstream runs this from `QuestieInit.lua` only, never from `cli/validate-*.lua`, so it is
-- invisible to Questie's own CI as well as to a naive differential. It is not a size
-- optimization: it changes the waypoints consumers draw, on 454 of the 480 Vanilla NPCs that
-- have them.
--
-- Two stages, in this order:
--
--   1. Ramer-Douglas-Peucker at tolerance 0.1, highest quality. Removes points.
--   2. Subdivision: any segment longer than `1.5 * (ZONE_SCALES[zone] or 1)` is replaced by
--      `ceil(dist/minDist)` interpolated points. ADDS points, because a waypoint line's
--      clickable area is a square, so long lines have to be broken up.
--
-- It also normalizes shape: a bare `{{x,y}, ...}` zone entry becomes `{{{x,y}, ...}}`.
--
-- Runs after Static Corrections in both Generation and Source mode. Storage and reads
-- preserve the resulting coordinates without quantization. The derived-pass fixtures in
-- test.lua check simplification, subdivision, and ordering against literal expected values.
