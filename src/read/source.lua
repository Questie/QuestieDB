-- src/read/source.lua
--
-- Source mode: entity reads resolve from raw entity data, with Static Corrections applied
-- live, because no generated TOC metadata store is present.
--
-- A fresh clone junctioned into `AddOns` is a working development environment with no
-- download and no Lua toolchain. Generating or bootstrapping a suffixed TOC switches the same
-- folder to Baked mode with no code change, because the client searches for flavour-suffixed
-- TOCs first and falls back to the base one only if none are found.
--
-- This file and src/read/baked.lua are the only two places the modes diverge. Both provide
-- exactly `readField(id, fieldIndex)` and `getAllIds()`.
--
-- ## Why this file loads before the data
--
-- The base TOC has to serve every client, so it lists all five expansions' data files — 78 MB
-- of Lua. Loading all of it would be absurd. Instead this file installs a `QuestieLoader`
-- shim ahead of them: each expansion's block is preceded by a marker file naming it, and the
-- shim discards a payload assignment whose expansion is not the running client's. The
-- discarded chunk's string constant becomes collectable as soon as that file returns, so peak
-- cost is one file rather than twenty.
