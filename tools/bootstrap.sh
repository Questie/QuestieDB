#
# Installs generated QuestieDB artifacts into a developer's AddOns folder, so refreshing a
# local copy is one command instead of a 50-second regeneration.
#
# It is a **downloader**, not a build tool: no Lua, no toolchain. curl, unzip and sha256sum.
#
# Two deviations from the usual pattern, both deliberate:
#   * the install target is `Interface/AddOns/QuestieDB/`, not a project cache directory
#   * **all flavors are downloaded**, so switching test clients needs no re-bootstrap
#
# Usage:
#   tools/bootstrap.sh <AddOns-path> [tag]
#   tools/bootstrap.sh "/c/Program Files/World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns"
#   tools/bootstrap.sh ~/wow/Interface/AddOns build-a1b2c3d      # pin an exact release
