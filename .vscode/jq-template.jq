          "text": "You are an expert Lua programmer specializing in World of Warcraft addons, particularly the QuestieDB database system for the Questie addon. Analyze the provided Lua source file to generate a concise context summary for an AI assistant (e.g., VSCode Copilot), *not* for human consumption. While brevity is crucial, provide a *brief explanation* for each main item listed under `KeyContributions`, detailing its purpose and how it functions. Focus on this file's unique responsibilities within QuestieDB. Highlight how this file's data or functions integrate or connect with other parts of the QuestieDB system (e.g., `Database` module, `Corrections` module, specific data tables). Structure your output as follows:\nFilePurpose: <brief statement of the file's primary goal within QuestieDB>\nKeyContributions:\n\t- <Function/Table Name>: <brief explanation of its purpose/role, what it does, and key interactions e.g., 'Main factory; populates `refTable` with DB structure (glob, override, getters) for `type`. Integrates with `Database` and `Corrections` modules.'>\n\t- <Another Key Item>: <brief explanation>\nRationale: <Why this file exists, its specific role in the QuestieDB architecture, and briefly how its contents relate to or are used by other database modules or Questie core. e.g., 'Centralizes creation logic for QuestieDB entity databases, promoting reuse. Provides standard handling for lazy loading, overrides, and typed getters, foundational to QuestieDB.'>\nExample (based on a file like Base.lua):\nFilePurpose: Core factory for creating and initializing individual database instances (e.g., ItemDB, NPCDB) within the QuestieDB system.\nKeyContributions:\n\t- CreateDatabaseInTable(refTable, databaseType, databaseTypeMeta): Main factory function; populates `refTable` with a complete database structure (lazy-loaded `glob`, `override` table, and various getter functions) for the specified `databaseType`. It orchestrates interactions with `LibQuestieDB.Database` for data loading and `LibQuestieDB.Corrections` for applying patches.\n\t- DB.InitializeDynamic(): Internal function called by `CreateDatabaseInTable`; sets up the metatable for `glob` to enable lazy-loading of data chunks from files on first access and loads initial override data via `DB.LoadOverrideData`.\n\t- DB.LoadOverrideData(includeDynamic?, includeStatic?): Loads and applies data corrections from the `Corrections` module to the current DB instance. It can selectively load dynamic (runtime) or static (pre-defined) corrections, updating the `override` table.\n\t- DB.AddStringGetter(numberKey, nameKey, defaultValue?): Factory function that generates and returns a specific getter (e.g., `GetName(id)`). This getter retrieves a string value for a given entity ID, first checking the `override` table, then the lazy-loaded `glob` table, and finally returning a `defaultValue` if not found.\nRationale: Centralizes the complex logic for creating and managing all QuestieDB entity-specific databases (like items, NPCs, quests). This promotes code reuse, ensures consistent database behavior (lazy loading, override application, typed data access), and forms a foundational architectural component for how QuestieDB structures and accesses its data. It decouples individual database types (ItemDB, NPCDB) from the core mechanics of data storage and retrieval.\n\nYour Task: Generate the .ai context summary for the following Lua code."
