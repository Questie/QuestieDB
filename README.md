# QuestieTDB

The database Questie consumes. Stores entity data as WoW addon TOC metadata, readable at
runtime with no file I/O, and owns the offline generator that produces it.

Quests, NPCs, items and objects for Classic Era, TBC, Wrath, Cataclysm and Mists. Baked
artifacts include nine generated Base locales as compressed CBOR column blocks. Dynamic
Translation Corrections can also supply any custom non-English locale. Source and Baked modes
return the same base entity values.

---

## Two modes, and the client picks

The client searches for flavour-suffixed TOCs first and falls back to `QuestieTDB.toc` only if
none are found. That rule selects the mode at no cost: **a generated artifact wins simply by
existing.**

| | Source mode | Baked mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TOC | `QuestieTDB.toc` (committed) | `QuestieTDB_Vanilla.toc` etc. (generated, gitignored) |
| Reads resolve from | raw entity data | CBOR rows and tables in the TOC metadata store |
| Static Corrections | applied live | already folded in |
| Base translations | unavailable | generated Localization blocks |
| Dynamic Translation Corrections | any active non-English locale | any active non-English locale |
| Requires | nothing but a clone | one bootstrap command, or Generation against pinned Questie |

A fresh clone junctioned into `AddOns` is a working development environment — no download, no
Lua toolchain. Generating an artifact switches the same folder to baked mode with no code
change. Generation reads localization from the Questie commit recorded in `QUESTIE_COMMIT` and
fails before writing output if the checkout or required lookup files do not match. Use
`--no-l10n` only for an intentional partial artifact.

---

## For consumers

Start at **[`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md)**. It is written so a third-party addon author needs no
source reading. Release zips also include LuaLS declarations under `QuestieTDB/Types`; point the
consumer's `workspace.library` at that folder for completion and diagnostics.

```lua
QuestDB.name(2)                                  --> "Sharptalon's Claw"
QuestDB.Get(2, "requiredLevel")                  --> 20
NpcDB.spawns(30)                                 --> { [12] = { {36.43, 55.89}, ... } }

LibQuestieDB.l10n.SetLocale("deDE")
QuestDB.name(2)                                  --> "Klaue von Scharfkralle"

LibQuestieDB.GetRegistrar("MyAddon")
    .Set("Quest", "my-fix", { [2] = { [1] = "A better name" } })  -- data slot; publishes immediately

LibQuestieDB.GetRegistrar("MyAddon")
    .RegisterRuntimeCorrection("Quest", "fixes", function() ... end, 10)  -- function form, for large sets

LibQuestieDB.l10n.SetCorrection("MyAddon", "deDE", "Quest", "text", {
    [2] = { [LibQuestieDB.Meta.Quest.keys.name] = "Klaue von Scharfkralle" },
})
```

Three behaviours to internalise before writing anything:

* **Numeric getters return `0`, never `nil`.** Test `~= 0`, not truthiness.
* **Every table read returns a fresh, deeply independent copy you own.** Mutate it freely;
  the next read is unaffected, and `CopyTable` is wasted work. `GetAllIds` is the one
  exception: it hands back a shared table, so treat that one as read-only.
* **Non-English translations are authoritative for translatable fields.** Publish translated
  entity text through `LibQuestieDB.l10n.SetCorrection`, not an ordinary entity Correction.
  The locale may be one of the nine generated locales or a custom non-English locale.

## For contributors

Use the root command for generation and validation workflows:

```sh
./questietdb generate                    # generate every flavor
./questietdb generate Vanilla            # generate one flavor
./questietdb check Vanilla               # standard validation bundle for one flavor
./questietdb verify equivalence Vanilla Mists
./questietdb all                         # Generation, standard gates, Golden, and unit tests
```

Run `./questietdb --help` for every gate and option. It requires Bash 5.1 or newer and selects
`lua5.1`, or a `lua` command that reports Lua 5.1. `LUA` and `--lua=` can select another Lua
5.1-compatible executable explicitly. The `freeze` gate supports Vanilla and Mists.

The individual entry points remain useful while developing a gate:

```sh
lua5.1 generate.lua all
lua5.1 verify.lua
lua5.1 equivalence.lua
lua5.1 reconstruct.lua Vanilla
lua5.1 validators/run.lua
lua5.1 test.lua
lua-language-server --check=src/types --checklevel=Warning --check_format=pretty

python3 tools/differential/golden.py check Vanilla
python3 tools/differential/compiler_diff.py Vanilla

tools/check.sh                    # verify, equivalence, reconstruct, validators, differential
tools/check.sh all                # Generation, standard gates, Golden, and unit tests
tools/check.sh verify --flavors=Vanilla,Mists
tools/check.sh determinism freeze --flavors=Vanilla
```

### Automatic Questie inputs for the generator

`lua5.1 generate.lua all` and `lua5.1 generate.lua meta` fetch the exact commit in
`QUESTIE_COMMIT` into `.cache/questie/<sha>` on first use. This directory is gitignored.
The fetch uses depth 1 and no tags, downloading the full pinned snapshot without its history.
Git and a POSIX shell with `mktemp` are required. The first run needs network access; subsequent
runs reuse the cache offline. Changing the pin creates a separate checkout rather than
resetting an existing one.

`--questie=<path>` overrides `QUESTIE_PATH`; either opts out of the automatic checkout.
The generator validates that checkout's commit but never fetches, switches, or cleans it.
`generate.lua toc` and `--no-l10n` do not fetch Questie.

Automatic fetching is limited to direct `generate.lua` invocations. The `./questietdb` check
runner, Reconstruction, imports, and compiler differential still default to `../Questie`.
Point their `--questie` or `QUESTIE_PATH` override at `.cache/questie/<sha>` to reuse this checkout.

Run the offline checkout tests with `lua5.1 tools/questie-checkout.test.lua`.

### Keeping LuaLS declarations in sync

The files in `src/types/` are shipped to consumers and are part of the public API. Update them
when a change affects an entity schema or getter, a public function signature or overload,
return nilability, a structured value such as objectives or Correction entries, or the
`LibQuestieDB` and Corrections interfaces. Pure implementation changes that preserve those
contracts do not need a type edit.

Update `src/types/consumer.test.lua` when the changed contract needs a semantic LuaLS check.
Run the `lua-types` suite and LuaLS command above before packaging. `AGENTS.md` maps each kind
of public change to the declaration files that own it.

`tools/check.sh` remains the direct orchestration engine for automation and existing scripts.
It accepts the previous gate syntax and `--flavors=Vanilla,Mists`.

The sweep parallelises by memory budget rather than core count, because the jobs are wildly
uneven — equivalence on Mists peaks at 1.66 GB and 57 s, on Vanilla at 0.42 GB and 19 s — so a
flat `-j N` either thrashes a laptop or leaves a workstation idle. `all` finishes Generation
for every selected flavor before any artifact reader or unit test starts. Determinism and
freeze checks remain available as explicit gates. The budget comes from `MemAvailable` at
startup; `--budget-mb=N` overrides it with a value from 1 to 2147483647 MB, and `--sequential`
turns fan-out off. Per-job logs land in `.out/checks/`.

The golden gate is the successor to the cross-implementation differential (built to
compare this tree against the independent `-pi` sibling, where it caught the Era-gating,
constants, and Titan Reforged defect chain). It guards the one class the other gates
cannot: generator and source mode being consistently wrong *together*. After an
intentional data change, `golden.py refresh <Flavor>` regenerates the snapshot for
review and commit.

`compiler_diff.py` is the reference-implementation differential DESIGN.md phase 6 called
for. It runs Questie's real compile path offline — the one `cli/validate-era.lua` already
drives — and compares `QuestieDB.Query<Type>Single` against this database's composed reads,
id by id and field by field. The golden snapshot can only catch drift from *this* tree;
this gate is the only one that can say whether the database still matches the thing it
replaces. It needs a Questie checkout (`--questie=../Questie`, the default) and `bit32` on
the Lua path, which it picks up from luarocks automatically. Accepted divergences live in
`tools/differential/compiler-baseline/`; `--update-baseline` re-records them for review.

Generation and the addon tooling use plain Lua 5.1 with no `lfs`, luarocks, or C dependency.
Inputs are enumerated in `src/config.lua` rather than discovered by scanning directories. The
compiler differential is the one exception because Questie's mocks require `bit32`.
`tools/check.sh --questie=` propagates one checkout path through Generation, fidelity tests,
Reconstruction, and the compiler differential; `QUESTIE_PATH` provides the same default for
nested tools.

To refresh a local install instead of regenerating:

```sh
tools/bootstrap.sh "/path/to/Interface/AddOns"
```

### Re-syncing with Questie

Entity schema, Corrections, and support data derive from Questie and are committed here, so
drift is a build failure rather than a discovery months later. Entity translations remain
direct Generation inputs from the pinned Questie checkout during migration. Their import
adapter isolates Questie's executable lookup and whole-row override formats from QuestieTDB's
three-part localization model, so transferring the authored files later does not require a
runtime or storage change. CI runs the fidelity checks and fails on any difference.

```sh
git -C ../Questie checkout "$(cat QUESTIE_COMMIT)"
lua5.1 generate.lua meta --questie=../Questie # schema -> src/meta/*Meta.lua
lua5.1 tools/port-corrections.lua ../Questie  # corrections + constants
lua5.1 generate.lua toc                      # refresh the committed Source-mode file list
lua5.1 test.lua support support-fidelity     # check all copied support data and flavor selection
lua5.1 test.lua objective-first              # check pinned hint contents and scope boundaries
lua5.1 test.lua objective-first-addon        # check generated and static-stripped addons
lua5.1 test.lua localization-overrides translation-corrections titan-translations
```

`objective-first` runs without generated entity artifacts. It compares all five published hint
tables with the pinned correction sources across base flavors, SoD, Titan Reforged, and negative
season cases. `objective-first-addon` requires all five generated artifacts and compares Source,
Baked, and a staged package after Static Correction stripping. Issue #19 can invoke these two
suites as its ObjectiveFirst release check rather than duplicate their persona matrix.

The localization suites compare every effective entity translation against pinned Questie across
all five flavors and nine locales, exercise Dynamic Translation Correction lifecycle and
precedence, and check Titan's Wrath season 109 zhCN set. Issue #19 can invoke these three suites as
its focused localization gate.

During import, Questie's `lookupOverrides.lua` whole-row replacements become named Static
Translation Correction fields. The internal value `false` explicitly clears an omitted field
before the result is filtered to existing entities and encoded. This sentinel belongs only to
the Generation adapter; it is not part of `LibQuestieDB.l10n.SetCorrection`.

The 24 support inputs, their pinned Questie paths, published fields, and Lua-source-string
fields are listed in [`tools/support-inventory.lua`](tools/support-inventory.lua). See
[`docs/support-data.md`](docs/support-data.md) before changing that inventory or support-file
selection.

The ported correction files preserve Questie's bytes except for explicit whole-function
ownership exclusions in `tools/port-corrections.lua`; a compat shim supplies the module surface
they import. The fidelity test compares every non-excluded byte and the port fails if an
excluded block is absent or duplicated. To advance Questie, change `QUESTIE_COMMIT` first,
check out that commit, then review schema drift, the Correction re-port, validators, compiler
differential, and Golden snapshots in the same working tree. Automation reads the same pin
through `.github/actions/checkout-questie`.

The port requires Questie's four Titan entity files under `Database/Corrections/`. QuestieTDB
ports them under `src/corrections/Titan/` and applies every provider dynamically over the Wrath
base, gated by Wrath plus active season 109. Titan quest tags and availability blacklists remain
in Questie because they are consumer policy.

```

`src/read/` is the only place the two modes diverge. Both backends expose field reads and ID
lists; Baked mode also exposes scalar rows and table producers for its cache fast paths.
