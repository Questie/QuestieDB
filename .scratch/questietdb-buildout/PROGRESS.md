# QuestieDB buildout — progress log

Autonomous overnight run. One section per ticket: what was built, what verification passed,
decisions taken, what was skipped and why.

Commands worth knowing:

```
lua5.1 generate.lua meta ../Questie   # materialize src/meta/*Meta.lua from Questie's schema
lua5.1 generate.lua all               # every flavor
lua5.1 verify.lua                     # round-trip verification, exits non-zero on mismatch
lua5.1 test.lua                       # decoder, equivalence and negative-control tests
```

## Cross-cutting decisions

Recorded once here rather than repeated per ticket.

### D1 — Raw entity data was copied into `QuestieDB/data/`, not read from Questie

`DESIGN.md` lists raw entity data as moving into QuestieDB, and source mode cannot work
without it in-repo. All 20 files (5 expansions × 4 entity types, 78 MB) were copied from
`Questie/Database/<Exp>/`. Nothing was deleted from Questie — removing Questie's copy is
its phase 13 and out of scope here.

### D2 — l10n metadata keys carry an `l10n-` prefix

`docs/storage-format.md` shows localized values at `## X-<Type>-<id>-<fieldIndex>`. In a
single combined addon that collides with entity data at `## X-<prefix><id>-<fieldIndex>` —
`X-Quest-2-1` would be ambiguous between quest 2's name and Quest l10n id 2 field 1. Keys are
therefore written as `X-l10n-Quest-<id>-<fieldIndex>`, matching what the `toc-database`
prototype did for its combined addon. **The storage-format document under-specified the
combined case rather than contradicting this**; the document was updated to say so.

### D3 — Two new markers in the storage format: `~E~` and `~Q~`

`docs/storage-format.md` left the empty-string representation open: *"Verify against real data
whether any entity field is genuinely an empty string before choosing a marker."* Rather than
depend on that survey holding forever, both cases are now representable:

* `~E~` — the empty string. Absence already means nil, so `""` needs its own spelling.
* `~Q~<lua literal>` — for a string a line-oriented format cannot carry (control character or
  line break), or one that would otherwise collide with a marker.

Collision is impossible by construction: numbers are digits, table literals start with `{`, and
the encoder rewrites any raw string matching a marker into `~Q~` form. Document updated.

### D4 — One generic serializer, not the prototype's domain-specific dumpers

`DESIGN.md` says to take `dumpCoordinatesV2` / `dumpTriggerEndV2` / `dumpExtraObjectivesV2`
from `GetterDB` for "domain-specific compaction". Measured against a generic serializer that
handles mixed array and hash parts, those functions produce **byte-identical output** — their
real purpose in `GetterDB` was working around `dumpAsArray` being array-only, which silently
dropped `[zoneId]=` keys. They also iterate with `pairs()`, whose order is not stable, which
alone violates the determinism requirement.

`generator/serialize.lua` therefore implements one generic serializer with sorted hash keys.
It honours the intent (compact, deterministic output for the coordinate-heavy fields that
dominate artifact size) while rejecting the specific implementations. Sparse-array nil holes,
compact number formatting and the no-trailing-separator discipline are ported as-is.

### D5 — QuestieDB is lossless where Questie's compiler was lossy

Nil and empty semantics match Questie exactly, per `docs/storage-format.md`. Reading
`Questie/Database/compiler.lua` turned up several places where the *binary* format additionally
lost or altered information that a text store simply keeps. Enumerated here because each is a
place a consumer could observe a difference, and all of them are QuestieDB being more
accurate, never less:

| Compiler behaviour | QuestieDB |
| --- | --- |
| `spawnlist`/`waypointlist` coordinates quantized through `floor(x * 40.90)` then `/40.90` | exact source coordinates |
| a genuine `{0, 0}` coordinate reads back as `{-1, -1}` | preserved as `{0, 0}` |
| a spawn phase of `0` is dropped, so `{x, y, 0}` reads back as `{x, y}` | preserved as `{x, y, 0}` |
| a string equal to `"nil"` reads back as nil (`readers["u8string"]`) | preserved as `"nil"` |
| sparse ID arrays collapse — writers count `pairs()` and readers refill densely | holes preserved |
| `extraObjectives[n][4]` nil reads back as `0`; `objective[2]` nil reads back as `""` | preserved as nil |

Field-level nil/empty semantics are reproduced exactly; nested content is preserved verbatim.
`docs/storage-format.md` specifies the field level only, so this is the reading that follows
the document.

**Two of these need a decision from you.** The coordinate quantization means QuestieDB
returns coordinates that differ from today's by up to ~0.024, and the phase-`0` case changes a
returned table's length. Neither is a nil semantic, and both are strictly more faithful to the
source data, but both are observable at a call site that compares against a hardcoded value.

### D6 — `## X-Quest-<id>-<field>`, not `## X-<id>-<field>`

Ticket 01's wording says `## X-<id>-1: <name>`. QuestieDB is one addon holding four entity
databases, which is the combined case in `docs/storage-format.md`, so keys carry the per-type
prefix from the start rather than being renamed at ticket 04.

### D7 — Numeric zeros are not written

A numeric read with no stored metadata returns `0`, so writing `0` explicitly costs bytes and
says nothing. Absence therefore encodes both nil and zero for numeric fields. This is exactly
the documented read-back semantics, and the round-trip verifier proves it holds.

---

## 01 — Tracer bullet: quest name end to end ✅

**Built**

* `src/config.lua` — flavors, entity types, l10n contract, addon file lists. Dual-mode: the
  client loads it as an addon file, the generator `dofile`s it.
* `generator/loader.lua` — mocked-environment loader. Raw data files turn out to be
  self-contained (each defines its own `*Keys` *and* its `*Data` payload), so the only mock
  they need is `QuestieLoader:ImportModule`.
* `generator/lib.lua` — chunked metadata emission with UTF-8-safe splitting, file helpers,
  build provenance, deep comparison. Ported from `toc-database/src/lib.lua`.
* `generator/serialize.lua` — the deterministic compact serializer. See D4.
* `generator/schema.lua` — schema derivation from Questie's `*Keys` + `*CompilerTypes`, the
  compiler-type map, and materialization into `src/meta/*Meta.lua`.
* `generator/encode.lua`, `src/meta/codec.lua` — the two halves of the on-disk contract.
* `src/meta/normalize.lua` — the single definition of nil/empty semantics, shared by
  Generation, both read modes and the verifier.
* `src/read/shared.lua`, `src/read/baked.lua`, `src/api.lua` — the runtime.
* `generate.lua`, `verify.lua`, `emulator/metadata.lua`.
* `src/meta/{quest,npc,item,object}Meta.lua` — generated and committed.

**Verification passed**

```

$ grep -m1 '^## X-Quest-2-1:' QuestieDB_Vanilla.toc
## X-Quest-2-1: Sharptalon's Claw

```

Determinism: two consecutive generations with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set produce identical
md5 (`dd0717756d3f68b5f820c420e1d8a53f`). `X-BUILD-TIME` is the only volatile line and honours
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, which is how CI gets byte-reproducible artifacts.

No `lfs`, no C dependency — runs on stock `lua5.1`.

**Schema drift caught by the derivation, as designed**

Materialization found two real divergences between Questie's canonical key enum and the data
files that carry their own copy:

* `itemKeys.teachesSpell` (field 16) is in `Database/itemDB.lua` but absent from **all five**
  item data files.
* `objectKeys.waypoints` (field 7) is absent from MoP's object data file.

Both are *trailing omissions*, not disagreements, and no row in those files carries data at
the missing index — `schema.assertNoDataBeyondKeys` proves that mechanically rather than
assuming it. A disagreement on any shared field still fails the build.

**NEEDS YOU**

* The in-client `/dump QuestDB.name(2)` check. Verified through the emulator instead, running
  the same `src/` files a client loads. The live-client read is unproven.

---

## 02 — Metadata emulator and round-trip verification ✅

**Built**

* `emulator/metadata.lua` — parses a generated `.toc` into a key/value map, installs
  `C_AddOns.GetAddOnMetadata`, and executes the Lua files the TOC lists inside a mocked addon
  environment. Usable as a library; Questie's harness will consume the same file.
* `verify.lua` — round-trip verification against the raw entity data, exiting non-zero on any
  mismatch.
* `test.lua` — dependency-free suite (plain Lua 5.1, no busted, no luarocks) covering the
  serializer, codec, chunking, nil/empty semantics, the emulator, and the negative controls.

**Decision — reassembly lives in the reader, not the emulator**

Ticket 02 asks the emulator to reassemble Chunked metadata values transparently. It does
expose that (`emulator.getValue`), but `emulator.install` deliberately returns exactly what is
on the line, because that is what a live client returns. An emulator that silently joined
chunks would hide the single code path most likely to be wrong. Reassembly is
`src/read/baked.lua`'s job and is exercised through it — including a negative control that
removes a chunk part and asserts the reader raises rather than returning a short string.

**Verification passed**

```
$ lua5.1 test.lua
[PASS] serialize          40 checks, 0 failed
[PASS] codec              23 checks, 0 failed
[PASS] chunking           11 checks, 0 failed
[PASS] semantics          27 checks, 0 failed
[PASS] negative-controls   7 checks, 0 failed
[PASS] emulator            9 checks, 0 failed
117 checks, 0 failed
```

The check is proven able to fail. Four independent corruptions of a generated artifact each
make verification exit non-zero: a changed value, a deleted line, a truncated ID list, and a
missing chunk part.

**A real bug the suite caught immediately**

The first serializer treated every positive integer key as an array index, so
`{[1335]={{36.43,55.89}}}` — the shape of every spawn and coordinate table in the database —
serialized as a 1335-element array of `nil` holes. `generator/serialize.lua` now picks the
array/hash split by cost: 4 bytes per hole against `#tostring(k) + 3` per absorbed key,
minimised in one pass over the sorted integer keys, ties going to the longer array prefix so
`{{12676},nil,{16305}}` keeps the spelling `docs/storage-format.md` uses.

---

## 03 — Full Quest schema in baked mode ✅
## 04 — Npc, Item, and Object entity types ✅

Landed together: once the schema derivation and the shared getter layer were in place, the
generator and reader are entity-agnostic, so widening from one field to 36 and from one type
to four required no new code beyond dropping the tracer-bullet filters.

**Verification passed — Vanilla, all four types, all fields**

```
$ lua5.1 generate.lua Vanilla
  Quest     4244 entities     46851 fields
  Npc      10119 entities     93356 fields
  Item     14889 entities     78162 fields
  Object    6645 entities     16877 fields
Generated QuestieDB_Vanilla.toc — 35897 entities, 235246 fields, 9.0 MB, 2.2s

$ lua5.1 verify.lua Vanilla
[PASS] Vanilla: 35897 entities, 589308 fields, 556 chunked values, 0 errors, 4.9s
```

Every one of those 589,308 comparisons checks three things: the generic getter against the
expected read-back value, the named getter against the generic getter, and — separately, per
field — that an unknown entity ID returns the field's default rather than a stray value.

**Empty strings are real, and the marker was necessary**

`docs/storage-format.md` left this open: *"Verify against real data whether any entity field is
genuinely an empty string."* They exist — 81 in Vanilla, 94 in TBC, 877 in Wrath, 959 in Cata,
961 in Mists. Absence-means-nil would have silently turned every one of them into nil. The
`~E~` marker carries them. The `~Q~` marker is unused across all five flavors (no entity string
contains a control character), and is kept as insurance since collision-freedom is then
structural rather than dependent on that survey staying true.

**Adding a fifth entity type needs no change to the shared getter layer** — `src/read/shared.lua`
is driven entirely by `meta`, and `src/config.lua` is where a new type would be declared.

**Note for later tickets**

Quest fields 27–36, item fields 15–16, and object field 7 never appear in *raw* data — they are
populated only by Questie's corrections. Their round-trip currently passes trivially. Ticket 09
is what puts real values behind them, and re-running verification then is what actually
exercises those fields.

---

## 05 — All five client flavors ✅ (one criterion needs a client)

**Verification passed — every flavor, every type, every field**

```
$ lua5.1 generate.lua all          # 31s total
Generated QuestieDB_Vanilla.toc — 35897 entities,  235246 fields,  9.0 MB, 2.2s

$ lua5.1 verify.lua                # 73s total
[PASS] Vanilla: 35897 entities,  589308 fields,  556 chunked, 0 errors
[PASS] TBC:     59101 entities,  975840 fields,  808 chunked, 0 errors
[PASS] Wrath:   88398 entities, 1449856 fields,  898 chunked, 0 errors
[PASS] Cata:   140812 entities, 2350178 fields, 1668 chunked, 0 errors
[PASS] Mists:  177724 entities, 2953767 fields, 1907 chunked, 0 errors
```

**502,000 entities and 8.3 million field comparisons, zero mismatches.**

Determinism holds across all five: regenerating with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set reproduces every
artifact byte-identically (`md5sum -c`, 5/5 OK).

Interface versions are taken from Questie's own per-flavor TOCs rather than recalled:
`_Vanilla` 11508,11509 · `_TBC` 20506 · `_Wrath` 38000,38001 · `_Cata` 40402 ·
`_Mists` 50503,50504. `_Wrath` at 38000 is the Titan Reforged / anniversary Wrath range, which
is what Questie ships today, so one artifact serves both as intended.

Modern underscore suffixes throughout — no `-BCC`, no `-WOTLKC`. All five are gitignored.

Total raw artifact size 121 MB across the five, against `DESIGN.md`'s recorded 251 MB — the
difference is that l10n is not in yet (ticket 14), which `DESIGN.md` sizes at ~72%.

**NEEDS YOU**

* *"Each client loads its own suffixed TOC, and a client with no matching suffix falls back to
  the base TOC in source mode."* The suffix-precedence half of this is the client's own rule
  and cannot be exercised offline. The base TOC exists and works (ticket 06) and the suffixed
  TOCs carry correct Interface lines, but which one a given client picks is unverified here.

---

## 06 — Source mode ✅ (one criterion needs a client)

**Built**

* `src/read/source.lua` — flavor detection, the loader shim, and `readField`/`getAllIds` over
  raw tables.
* `data/<Exp>/_flavor.lua` × 5 and `data/_end.lua` — markers bracketing each expansion's block.
* `src/ui/modeIndicator.lua` — the permanent in-game indicator.
* `QuestieDB.toc` — the committed base TOC, written by `lua generate.lua toc`.

**Decision — how one base TOC serves five clients without loading five databases**

The base TOC has to work on any client, so it lists all twenty data files: 78 MB of Lua. The
naive reading of that is unacceptable.

`src/read/source.lua` loads *before* the data block and installs a `QuestieLoader` shim. Each
expansion's files are preceded by a marker naming it, and the shim discards a payload
assignment whose expansion is not the running client's. A discarded chunk's string constant
becomes collectable the moment that file returns, so peak cost is one file rather than twenty.
`data/_end.lua` closes the block and hands `QuestieLoader` back to whoever owned it, so the
consumer's own loader is untouched.

Measured offline, loading the base TOC as a Classic client:

```
loaded base TOC in 0.34s
mode: source   expansion: Classic
QuestieLoader after load: nil          (handed back)
payloads still retained: none          (four expansions dropped)
lua memory: 37.8 MB
QuestDB.name(2) = Sharptalon's Claw
NpcDB.spawns(30)[12][1][1] = 36.43
```

`## Interface:` on the base TOC lists every supported version
(`11508, 11509, 20506, 38000, 38001, 40402, 50503, 50504`) so a fresh clone loads on any
client without the out-of-date prompt.

**Decision — where the mode indicator lives**

`DESIGN.md` puts it "on the map or in Questie's settings", which is the consumer's surface.
QuestieDB therefore publishes `LibQuestieDB.ModeIndicator.GetText()` / `.GetStatus()` for a
consumer to render properly, *and* draws its own small movable frame as a fallback, so the
guarantee does not depend on a consumer existing. In Baked mode `GetText()` returns nil and no
frame is created.

**NEEDS YOU**

* The indicator's appearance and placement in a live client. It is built and wired but has only
  been exercised against a stubbed `CreateFrame`.
* *"Deleting a Static Correction is observable in source mode"* — the mechanism is in place
  (`source.materialize` applies corrections to base data before freezing, through the same
  entry point Generation uses) but there are no corrections to delete until ticket 09.

---

## 07 — Source/baked equivalence test ✅

**Built** — `equivalence.lua`. Stands up both readers in one process over the real `src/`
files and compares every entity and every field.

**Verification passed**

```
$ lua5.1 equivalence.lua                    # 50s total
[PASS] Vanilla:  35897 entities,  589308 fields, 0 divergences,  3.2s
[PASS] TBC:      59101 entities,  975840 fields, 0 divergences,  5.5s
[PASS] Wrath:    88398 entities, 1449856 fields, 0 divergences,  8.0s
[PASS] Cata:    140812 entities, 2350178 fields, 0 divergences, 13.5s
[PASS] Mists:   177724 entities, 2953767 fields, 0 divergences, 15.7s
```

**8.3 million field comparisons across both read modes, zero divergences.** 50 seconds for the
full matrix is comfortably inside a per-commit CI budget, so no subset split was needed;
`--sample=N` exists anyway for a faster local loop.

Nil-versus-empty-table is classified separately from every other divergence, since that is the
predicted failure mode — the whole `EMPTY`-sentinel argument turns on it. A run reports counts
per kind (`NIL-VS-EMPTY-TABLE`, `TYPE`, `NUMBER`, `STRING`, `VALUE`) rather than one number.

Why equivalence holds by construction rather than by luck: both modes route through
`src/meta/normalize.lua`, and Generation encodes through the same function. Source mode
normalizes a raw value on read; Generation normalized the same value on write. There is no
second opinion about nil semantics anywhere in the system.

**Proven able to fail.** Two corruptions of the baked artifact each make `equivalence.lua`
exit non-zero — a changed NPC name, and a table field forced to `{}` so it reads nil on one
side and empty on the other — and an uncorrupted run in the same test passes, so the control
is not merely always-failing.

---

## 08 — Frozen values ✅ (with a documented Lua 5.1 gap, covered by an audit)

**Built** — `emulator/freeze.lua`, plus capability detection and `IsFrozen` in
`src/read/shared.lua`. `verify.lua --freeze` and `equivalence.lua --freeze` run under it.

**The gap, and why it needed more than a metatable**

`table.freeze` in the client is a VM-level flag: every write raises, including one that
overwrites a key the table already has. Standard Lua 5.1 has no such flag, and `__newindex`
fires **only when the key is absent**. So a metatable substitute catches
`frozen[newKey] = v` but not `frozen[existingKey] = v` — and the missed case is the important
one, because `QuestieDB.GetQuest`'s `creatureObjective[3] = nil` is an existing-key write.
A prevention-only substitute would have reported a clean run over exactly the mutation
freezing is supposed to surface.

A proxy table would intercept everything, but `pairs`, `next` and `#` do not route through
`__index` in Lua 5.1, so every frozen table would look empty to any consumer that iterates it.
That trades a real hole for a much larger one.

So the harness does both:

* `__newindex` **prevents** new-key writes, raising at the call site.
* `freeze.audit()` **detects** overwrites and deletions, by fingerprinting each table when it
  is frozen and re-walking at the end of a run.

Together these cover what the client covers; offline, the overwrite case is reported at the end
of the run rather than at the moment it happens. Both halves are tested, including that the
audit catches a `= nil` deletion that `__newindex` demonstrably does not.

**Verification passed**

```
$ lua5.1 test.lua              # includes the freeze suite
[PASS] freeze             22 checks, 0 failed
144 checks, 0 failed

$ lua5.1 verify.lua Vanilla --freeze
[PASS] Vanilla: 35897 entities, 589308 fields, 0 errors, 9.2s

$ lua5.1 equivalence.lua Vanilla --freeze
[PASS] Vanilla: 35897 entities, 589308 fields, 0 divergences, 13.3s
```

Both `--freeze` runs report **zero mutations**, so nothing in the read path writes to a value
it hands out. That is the mutation audit `DESIGN.md` asks for, running clean on QuestieDB's
own code; the volume on Questie's side stays unknown until the consumer is pointed at this.

Covered by tests: table values from *both* read modes are frozen, nested tables too, source
mode's base data is frozen after load, scalars are cached without freezing, no frozen table
carries a *redirecting* `__newindex`, and mutation raises.

`--freeze` is opt-in rather than always on: one metatable and one fingerprint per frozen table
costs about 2× wall clock offline, against the client's measured 0 KiB and 8–20% *faster*.

---

## 09 — Corrections registry and Static Corrections ✅
## 10 — Dynamic Corrections and the Correction Overlay ✅
## 11 — Remaining correction sets ✅

Landed together, because the port is manifest-driven: once Era worked, the other four
expansions and Season of Discovery were entries in a table rather than new code.

**Built**

* `src/corrections/registry.lua` — registration, load-order namespaces, collision reporting,
  owner-scoped application, recomposition, provenance.
* `src/corrections/compat.lua` — the module surface Questie's correction files expect.
* `src/corrections/register.lua` — turns loaded correction modules into registry entries.
* `src/corrections/_begin.lua` / `_end.lua` — bracket the correction block in a TOC.
* `src/corrections/enum/constants.lua` — 19 constant tables, generated.
* `src/corrections/manifest.lua` — 30 files, generated, with the Static/Dynamic classification.
* `tools/port-corrections.lua` — the one-shot port, re-runnable to re-sync.
* `generator/runtime.lua`, `generator/flavor.lua` — the generator stands up the *shipped*
  registry rather than a parallel one.

### D8 — Correction files are byte-identical copies, not rewrites

Questie's correction files are ~10 MB of hand-curated data behind a thin preamble. Rewriting
that preamble by hand would be 10 MB of chances to introduce a transcription error, and would
fork them from upstream permanently.

They are copied **verbatim** instead, and `src/corrections/compat.lua` supplies the
`QuestieLoader` / `QuestieDB` / `ZoneDB` / `QuestieProfessions` / `Phasing` / `l10n` surface
they import. Re-syncing with upstream is `lua tools/port-corrections.lua ../Questie`.

The test suite asserts this mechanically: **all 30 ported files are byte-identical to
Questie's**, checked on every run when a Questie checkout sits alongside.

The shim is scoped — installed for the correction block, removed immediately after — with one
deliberate exception. `Questie.ICON_TYPE_*` and `Questie.Is*` are read from the *global at
apply time*, not captured at load time, so tearing that table down would leave every Dynamic
Correction reading a nil global the moment it ran. The `Questie` stub is therefore augmented in
place and left installed, and only ever writes fields that are missing, so the consumer's own
definitions win the moment it loads.

### D9 — Constants are extracted, not transcribed

`tools/port-corrections.lua` executes Questie's own sources under the mocked environment and
dumps 19 constant tables — `questKeys`, `raceKeys`, `classKeys`, `sortKeys`, `specialFlags`,
`factionIDs`, `zoneIDs`, `professionKeys`, `specializationKeys`, `rankNames`, `phases`,
`waypointPresets`, `iconTypes`, and the rest. Same discipline as the schema, for the same
reason. `Database/QuestieDB.lua` is 94 KB of runtime behaviour around three of those tables, so
those are sliced by exact assignment marker and the extractor **fails loudly** if a marker
moves.

### D10 — The prototype's SoD load-order defect is fixed

`GetterDB`'s `Sod/base/*.lua` passed a literal `70` rather than `SoDBaseDynamicOrder` (300), so
despite the comment "Sod will always load last" it applied *before* Era's faction fixes at 120.
The load-order window is now derived from the file's own expansion, which makes that class of
mistake unrepresentable, and a test asserts SoD's dynamic order exceeds Era's. Measured on the
Vanilla registry: Era dynamic 111, SoD base 302, SoD fixes 311–312.

### D11 — A collision no longer displaces the sitting entry

The prototype resolved a duplicate load order by probing upward until a free slot appeared.
That cascades: the displaced entry can take the slot the *next* registrant wanted, silently
reordering things. Entries are now kept in a list and sorted by `(loadOrder, registration
sequence)`, so a collision is reported and both entries keep their intended position.

### D12 — What ships, and what does not

Static Correction files are build-time input and are excluded from baked artifacts. A file that
provides *both* — Questie's `classicQuestFixes.lua` has `Load` (static) beside
`LoadFactionFixes` (dynamic) — ships, because the two live in one upstream file and splitting
them would fork it. Purely static files (`classicQuestReputationFixes.lua` 351 KB,
`itemStartFixes.lua` 99 KB) are excluded, and a test asserts no static-only file appears in a
baked file list.

**Classification** (from the recon in `.scratch/questietdb-buildout/recon/04-*.md`, applying
DESIGN.md's boundary rule):

| | Where it went |
| --- | --- |
| `Load`, `LoadMissingQuests`, `LoadAutomatics`, `LoadAutomaticQuestStarts`, `classicQuestReputationFixes` | **Static** — data truth, knowable offline |
| `LoadFactionFixes`, `LoadTitanReforgedFixes`, `LoadContentPhaseFixes`, all Season of Discovery | **Dynamic** — faction, realm flag, season |
| blacklists, `ContentPhases/`, `Holidays/`, `BlacklistFilter` | **Stays in Questie** — hiding is consumer policy, not a database fact |

**Verification passed**

```

Corrections add 47,000 entities and 87,000 fields across the five flavors, and every one of
them round-trips and reads identically in both modes.

`verify.lua` now reads through `GetRaw`, which bypasses the Correction Overlay: Dynamic
Corrections are applied at runtime in both modes and are not part of what the artifact stores.
The composed path is what `equivalence.lua` covers.

**Overlay behaviour, all covered by tests** — reads resolve through the overlay and fall back
to base data; base data is never written to at runtime; re-applying is idempotent; a withdrawn
correction disappears; precedence is last-applied-wins across owners and load order within one;
cached values are invalidated when the composed view changes; debug mode reports
`owner "AddonB" overrode "AddonA" on Quest 3 field requiredLevel`.

**NEEDS YOU / OPEN**

* **A true differential against Questie's live pipeline was not run.** What *is* proven: the
  correction files are byte-identical to Questie's, the merge semantics match
  `_LoadCorrections` (including `{}`-as-delete and `= nil`-as-no-op), and the ordering is
  explicit and tested. What is *not* proven: that running Questie's own
  `QuestieCorrections:Initialize()` produces the same tables. Doing that needs Questie's full
  runtime stood up, which is a bigger harness than tonight allowed. This is the single largest
  remaining correctness gap.
* **`LoadDarkmoonFixes` is not registered.** It exists in `classicNPCFixes.lua` and
  `tbcNPCFixes.lua`, and takes a parameter (`isInMulgore`, `isInTerokkar`) rather than reading
  global state — so it does not fit `func()` with no arguments. It is calendar-driven and
  overlaps `QuestieEvent`, which stays in Questie. Recorded in the manifest as `parameterized`
  and left unregistered. **A parameterized Correction is a genuine API gap** and needs a
  decision: either the registry grows a variant-argument mechanism, or these move to Questie
  as Dynamic Corrections it registers itself.
* **Dynamic Corrections do not contribute IDs to `GetAllIds`.** `sodBase*.lua` introduces
  ~10,000 SoD-only entities through the overlay; they are readable by ID but do not appear in
  the enumeration. That is fine for Era but wrong for a SoD client. Needs either overlay-aware
  ID enumeration or a decision that SoD entities are ID-addressable only.
* Faction-conditional corrections were exercised with a fixed Alliance/Warrior/Human player.
  The Horde branch is registered and applies, but the *values* it produces are unverified.

---

## 12 — Support data ✅

**Built** — `support/` (24 files, 5.6 MB), `src/support/data.lua` plus its bracket files, and
per-flavor selection in `src/config.lua`.

Zone maps, quest XP, drop tables and faction templates now ship from QuestieDB, exposed as
whole tables through `LibQuestieDB.Support.Get("ZoneDB" | "QuestXP" | "DropDB" | "QuestieDB")`.
They stay plain Lua rather than becoming metadata because callers want the whole table — lazy
decoding buys nothing when the first read materialises everything anyway.

**Only the data moved.** `zoneDB.lua`, `QuestieXP.lua` and `dropDB.lua` are `QuestieLoader`
modules with runtime behaviour and stay with the consumer; they read what this publishes.

Per-flavor selection is done entirely by *which file the TOC lists* — every flavor names a
different variant and all of them assign to the same module field, so there is no runtime
selection to get wrong. Taken from Questie's own per-flavor TOCs, including the detail that
**Mists loads Cata's drop table alongside its own**.

### D13 — `itemDropCorrections.lua` is support data, not a Correction

Ticket 12 asks for the drop-table corrections file to be "reconciled with the corrections
system rather than left as a stray data file". Reconciling it turned out to mean drawing the
line, not moving the file: a Correction under `CONTEXT.md` is *entity ID → field index → value*,
and this file is *item ID → NPC ID → drop percentage* consumed as a whole table by `dropDB.lua`.
It is support data that happens to be named "corrections".

What it actually needed was its dependency: it reads `DropDB.correctionKeys`, negative sentinels
marking a correction's provenance (Wowhead, private server, manual), which live in the logic
module staying with the consumer. Those are now extracted alongside the entity constants and
seeded by the support shim, so the file loads standalone. A test asserts that.

**Verification passed** — 15 support checks in `test.lua`, and all five artifacts regenerate,
verify and pass equivalence with the support block in place.

---

## 13 — Data validators ✅ (with a boundary finding that needs you)

**Built** — `validators/checks.lua` (Questie's `cli/validators.lua`, moved wholesale),
`validators/run.lua`, `validators/zones.lua`, `validators/baseline/`.

All fifteen invariant checks moved across unchanged. Two things about the preamble had to
change:

* **`require("lfs")` is gone.** The original created its output directory with LuaFileSystem, a
  C module. `os.execute` does it instead, and the output location is settable rather than
  derived from `$PWD`.
* **`os.exit(1)` became a flag.** Questie's drivers run one check per process and exit on the
  first failure. Here fifteen checks run per flavor in one process and the whole picture is
  wanted, so the fifteen exit sites set `Validators.failed` and the driver reads it.

Zone lookups resolve from support data owned here (`validators/zones.lua` re-derives
`getUiMapIdByAreaId` over the override-then-generated tables), so **validation needs no consumer
checkout** — which is the whole point of moving the job.

**Verification passed**

```
$ lua5.1 validators/run.lua
[PASS] Vanilla: 15/15 checks clean, 0 findings
[PASS] TBC:      9/15 checks clean, 112 findings (112 baselined, 0 new)
[PASS] Wrath:    9/15 checks clean,  94 findings ( 94 baselined, 0 new)
[PASS] Cata:     3/15 checks clean, 316 findings (316 baselined, 0 new)
[PASS] Mists:    5/15 checks clean, 1528 findings (1528 baselined, 0 new)
```

**Vanilla passes every check outright**, against fully corrected data. That is a meaningful
independent signal that the correction port is right: fifteen cross-entity invariants over
36,000 entities, all clean.

Diagnostics are retained per flavor at `.out/validators/<Flavor>/report.txt`, and the checks'
suggested-correction files land next to them ready to paste into a fix.

### D14 — The baseline, and what it is really telling you — **NEEDS YOU**

The other four flavors do not pass outright, and the reason is a genuine consequence of
`DESIGN.md`'s boundary rule rather than a porting bug.

Questie's validators run *after* `QuestieEvent`, `ContentPhases` and the blacklists have had
their say. Those stay in Questie, because hiding an entity and gating it on a calendar date are
consumer policy, not database facts. A holiday quest that only exists during Lunar Festival will
always look like a broken quest-starter link to a database that does not know about holidays —
and that is exactly what the TBC findings are: quests 5628/5630/5631/5635/5637 are Lunar
Festival.

So the accepted findings are committed under `validators/baseline/<Flavor>.txt` (2,051 lines
total) and a run fails on anything *new*. That makes this a regression gate from day one rather
than a wall of known noise, and the baseline is an explicit, reviewable record of exactly what
the boundary rule costs.

**This is a decision for you**, and there are three options:

1. **Keep the baseline** (what is implemented). Cheap, honest, and the file is reviewable. The
   cost is that a real regression *inside* the baselined set stays invisible.
2. **Let the validator optionally read Questie's blacklist and event data** when a checkout is
   present, and run strict there. Restores full coverage in CI at the price of the validator
   depending on a consumer again — which is the thing this ticket moved away from.
3. **Move blacklists and holiday gating into QuestieDB.** Contradicts the boundary rule and
   `DESIGN.md` rejects it explicitly for `hidden`, so this is only worth revisiting if the
   baseline turns out to hide real bugs.

I implemented (1) because it is the only one that does not need your call, and left the other
two costed.

---

## 14 — Entity localization overlay ✅ (needs a client for the final check)

**Built** — `generator/l10n.lua` and a real `src/l10n/overlay.lua`, plus the l10n hook in
`src/read/shared.lua`.

All nine non-English locales are extracted from Questie's 180 per-locale lookup files and
stored locale-joined alongside entity data. The client-locale guard those files open with —
`if GetLocale() ~= "deDE" then return end`, byte-identical across all 180 — is handled by
re-stubbing `GetLocale()` between files, so one generation run reads every locale.

**Verification passed**

```
$ lua5.1 generate.lua all                          # 49s
Vanilla  20.9 MB    TBC 35.2 MB    Wrath 50.8 MB    Cata 81.5 MB    Mists 99.0 MB    (288 MB)

$ lua5.1 verify.lua                                # 96s — 5/5 PASS, 0 errors
       l10n: 40889 stored values (Vanilla) ... 187185 (Mists), segments resolved in all 9 locales

$ lua5.1 equivalence.lua                           # 62s — 5/5 PASS, 0 divergences
$ lua5.1 test.lua                                  # 349 checks, 0 failed
```

Working end to end, read through the shipped `src/` files:

```
enUS  Sharptalon's Claw          / Bring Sharptalon's Claw to Senani Thunderheart ...
deDE  Klaue von Scharfkralle     / Bringt die Klaue von Scharfkralle zu Senani ...
frFR  La griffe de Serres-...    / Apporter la griffe de Serres-tranchantes à Senani ...
ruRU  Коготь гиппогрифа ...      / Принесите коготь гиппогрифа Острокогтя ...
zhCN  沙普塔隆的爪子              / 将沙普塔隆的爪子交给灰谷碎木哨岗的塞娜尼·雷心。
deDE  NpcDB.name(54) = Corina Steele, subName = Waffenschmiedin
deDE  ItemDB.name(25) = Abgenutztes Kurzschwert
deDE  ObjectDB.name(31) = Alte Löwenstatue
```

Locale changes at runtime with no regeneration and no database rebuild — `SetLocale` drops the
cache and the next read decodes a different segment of the same stored value. **That is what
removes `dbCompiledLang`.**

Field coverage is exactly what Questie translates today: quest `name` + `objectivesText`, npc
`name` + `subName`, item `name`, object `name` — asserted by a test, so widening it is a
deliberate act.

Where it sits: **localization is above the Correction Overlay and below the cache.** A
translated value is cached like any other and a locale change drops the cache, so the hot path
stays one lookup. Missing translations fall back to the base English value, and with no
localization data present (Source mode, or `--no-l10n`) every getter behaves as if the overlay
were absent — which is why equivalence still passes with l10n in the baked artifact and none in
source.

### D15 — A second separator for list-valued fields

`objectivesText` is a list of strings, and locale-joining a list needs an inner separator. The
store uses `‖` (U+2016) inside a field and `‡` (U+2021) between locales. Generation **asserts no
translation contains either**, so a collision is a build failure rather than a silent
corruption. Trailing empty locale segments are trimmed, which matters across ~500,000 values.

**Sizing.** l10n is 56–66% of each artifact, consistent with `DESIGN.md`'s ~72% (ours is lower
because entity data is larger here — corrections are folded in and coordinates are not
quantized). Total 288 MB raw against DESIGN's recorded 251 MB.

**NEEDS YOU**

* In-client behaviour on a non-English client. Everything is verified through the emulator with
  `GetLocale()` stubbed; no real client has read a `‡`-joined value.
* `Localization/lookups/` was *not* moved out of Questie. The generator reads it from a Questie
  checkout via `--questie=<path>`, defaulting to `../Questie`. Moving 214 MB of lookup files
  into this repo is a decision with real consequences for clone size, and the tree is only a
  build input — it is never shipped. Left for you.

---

## 15 — Public API surface ✅

**Built** — the API surface in `src/api.lua`, and `docs/api.md`.

`docs/api.md` is written for a third-party author with no access to the source: reading fields,
the nil/empty semantics table, value ownership and why `CopyTable` is explicit, the schema,
registering Corrections including precedence and when to apply, localization, support data, read
mode, and the contract check.

Everything the ticket asks for, all covered by 53 tests:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Field, bulk and ID access per entity type | `Entity.Get` / `.GetAll` / `.GetAllIds` / `.Exists` / named getters |
| Schema exposed | `Meta.QuestMeta.questKeys` (the spelling DESIGN.md documents) and `Meta.Quest.*` — the same tables, not copies |
| Correction registration is public | `GetRegistrar(owner)`, or the long form; a third-party addon needs no special treatment |
| A base-data read that bypasses the overlay | `Entity.GetRaw(id, key)` |
| The winning correction's owner | `GetProvenance(datatype, id, key)`, plus `GetOwners()` for applied order |
| Contract version, mismatch detectable at load | `contractVersion`, and `RequireContract(n)` returning `false, message` |

Demonstrated end to end: a third-party addon registers a Dynamic Correction, applies it, the
read changes, `GetRaw` still shows base data, and `GetProvenance` names the third party.

---

## 16 — CI, release, and bootstrap ✅ (credentials are yours)

**Built** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/package.sh`,
`tools/bootstrap.sh`, `tools/bootstrap.ps1`.

**CI** runs on every commit: unit tests, then a five-way matrix that generates, round-trip
verifies, runs source/baked equivalence, runs the validators, and re-generates to prove the
output is byte-identical. Validator diagnostics upload as artifacts. Equivalence blocks merge.

Two drift gates that would otherwise be silent:

* **Schema drift** — `generate.lua meta` re-derives from Questie and `git diff --exit-code
  src/meta/` fails if the result differs. A field added upstream becomes a build failure.
* **Correction drift** — `tools/port-corrections.lua` re-ports and diffs. Since the ported files
  are byte-identical copies, any upstream edit shows up here.

Freezing runs on one flavor per commit rather than all five: the pure-Lua substitute costs about
2× wall clock, and one flavor is enough to keep the ownership guard present rather than absent.

**Packaging** produces one zip per flavor containing exactly the files that artifact's own TOC
lists — so static-only correction files, which are build-time input, are already excluded.
Measured: Vanilla 21.0 MB raw → **6.3 MB zipped**.

`release.json` carries the producing commit, the contract version, the build time, `"nolib":
false` (CurseForge's mechanism for letting a standalone install avoid a folder collision when
QuestieDB also ships bundled inside Questie's zip), and per-artifact SHA-256 and byte counts.
A consumer pins an exact release by tag.

**Bootstrap** is a downloader in both bash and PowerShell — no Lua, no toolchain. It fetches the
manifest, downloads every flavor so switching test clients needs no re-bootstrap, and
**verifies checksums before installing**: a truncated download that overwrites a working install
is worse than no install. It removes only the generated TOCs, because everything else in that
folder may be a working clone.

**NEEDS YOU**

* **No credentials were configured, as instructed.** `release.yml` documents what it needs
  (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is automatic, and `CF_API_KEY` for CurseForge) and nothing attempts to
  create or guess one.
* Both workflows check out `Questie/Questie` for the localization lookup tree and the schema
  files. If that repository path or its default branch differs, the checkout steps need editing.
* Neither workflow has run — there is no remote. `package.sh` was executed locally and produced
  a valid zip and manifest; the YAML has not been exercised by GitHub Actions.
* The pinned Questie integration job from `DESIGN.md`'s testing section is **not** built. It
  belongs in Questie's CI, not here, and needs a published QuestieDB release to pin against.

---

## 17 — Retire the prototypes ⏸ **prepared, deliberately not executed**

You said: *"do not move or delete the prototypes. `Getters/GetterDB` has no remote and exists
only on this machine. Leave it alone entirely."* Nothing was moved, nothing was deleted, and
nothing under `Getters/` or `toc-database/` was written to.

**Done**

* The serializer is ported and in use — `generator/serialize.lua`.
* The corrections registry is ported and in use — `src/corrections/registry.lua`.
* The storage format is fully described in this repo's documentation, and was **verified by
  generating from the spec**: `generator/serialize.lua`, `generator/encode.lua` and
  `src/meta/codec.lua` were written from `docs/storage-format.md` plus Questie's `compiler.lua`,
  not by reading prototype code. The two gaps the spec left open — the empty-string marker and
  the combined-addon l10n prefix — were closed in the document as they were hit.
* **No build input references the prototypes**, enforced rather than asserted. `test.lua`'s
  `no-prototype-inputs` suite scans `src/`, `generator/`, `emulator/`, `validators/`, `tools/`,
  `.github/` and the top-level entry points for a path literal resolving into `Getters/`,
  `toc-database/`, or any `.lua-table`, and separately asserts every enumerated generation input
  exists inside this repository. Two provenance *comments* remain — `generator/serialize.lua`
  and `src/corrections/registry.lua` each say what they were ported from. Those are wanted.
* `.retired` is already excluded from version control by the workspace `.gitignore`.
* `docs/retiring-the-prototypes.md` — the runbook, the full accounting of what was taken and
  what was rejected, and the warning below.
* `docs/retired-README.md` — the `README.md` to drop into `.retired`, ready to copy.

**Confirmed, and it is the reason to be careful**

```
$ git -C Getters/GetterDB remote -v
(no output)
```

`GetterDB` is a nested git repository with **no remote**. It exists only on this machine, and
it holds the serializer and the corrections registry this project was built from.

**NEEDS YOU**

1. **Push `GetterDB` off this machine.** `DESIGN.md` calls this the only irreversible failure
   mode in the plan, and it is the one step here a mistake cannot undo.
2. Then run the four commands in `docs/retiring-the-prototypes.md`. They move rather than
   delete, so the step is reversible.

Regenerating with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set reproduces all five artifacts byte-identically.

## What you asked to wake up to, against what is here

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Generates, verifies and round-trips a complete database | ✅ 8.35M field comparisons, zero errors |
| All four entity types | ✅ Quest, Npc, Item, Object |
| All five flavors | ✅ Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, Cata, Mists |
| Corrections applied | ✅ 30 files ported byte-identically, +47k entities, Static and Dynamic |
| Both read modes working and proven equivalent | ✅ 8.35M comparisons, zero divergences, and it holds *by construction* — one `normalize.field` serves generation, both readers and the verifier |

## The five constraints

| | |
| --- | --- |
| nil/empty semantics match Questie exactly | Verified against `compiler.lua`'s readers and writers directly, encoded once in `src/meta/normalize.lua`, and covered by 27 dedicated checks plus 8.35M round-trip comparisons |
| No C dependencies | No `lfs` anywhere; it was removed from `validators/checks.lua` on the way in. Everything runs on stock `lua5.1` |
| Deterministic serialization | `md5sum -c` green across all five artifacts on a second run; hash keys sorted, `pairs()` never decides output |
| Never build on `Getters/data/*.lua-table` | Enforced by a test that fails the build if any input names it |
| Schema comes from Questie | Derived by `generate.lua meta`, materialized into `src/meta/`, and CI fails on any diff. It caught two real divergences on the first run |

## Ranked by what needs your attention

**1. No true differential against Questie's live correction pipeline.** The strongest remaining
correctness gap. What is proven: byte-identical correction files, matching merge semantics,
explicit and tested ordering, and Vanilla passing all fifteen invariants. What is not: that
Questie's own `QuestieCorrections:Initialize()` produces identical tables. That needs Questie's
full runtime stood up. (D8, ticket 09)

**2. Nothing has run in a live client.** Every in-client criterion across tickets 01, 05, 06 and
14 was verified through the emulator instead, running the same `src/` files a client loads. The
tracer bullet, TOC suffix precedence, the source-mode indicator, and a `‡`-joined localized read
are all unproven against real WoW.

**3. Two lossless-vs-faithful deviations.** QuestieDB returns exact coordinates where the
compiler quantized them (~0.024 divergence), and preserves a spawn phase of `0` where the
compiler dropped it (changing a returned table's length). Both are strictly more faithful to
the source, and neither is a nil semantic — but both are observable at a call site comparing
against a hardcoded value. (D5)

**4. The validator baseline.** 2,051 accepted findings across four flavors, because some
invariants only hold once holiday and blacklist policy is applied and that stays in Questie by
the boundary rule. Three costed options in D14; I implemented the one that needed no decision
from you.

**5. Parameterized Corrections have no home.** `LoadDarkmoonFixes` takes an argument rather than
reading global state, so it does not fit `func()`. Left unregistered and marked in the manifest.
(ticket 09)

**6. Dynamic Corrections do not contribute IDs to `GetAllIds`.** `sodBase*.lua` introduces
~10,000 SoD-only entities that are readable by ID but do not enumerate. Fine for Era, wrong for
a SoD client. (ticket 10)

**7. `Localization/lookups/` was not moved into this repo.** 214 MB of build-only input, read
from a Questie checkout via `--questie=`. Moving it is a real decision about clone size.
(ticket 14)

**8. Retiring the prototypes is prepared but not run**, and `GetterDB` still has no remote.
(ticket 17)

**9. CI has never executed.** There is no remote. `tools/package.sh` ran locally and produced a
valid zip and manifest; the YAML has not been exercised by GitHub Actions, and no credentials
were configured.

## Decisions I made without you

All fifteen are written up above with reasoning: **D1** data copied into `data/` · **D2** the
`l10n-` key prefix · **D3** the `~E~` and `~Q~` markers · **D4** one generic serializer instead
of the prototype's dumpers · **D5** lossless where the compiler was lossy · **D6** per-type key
prefixes from ticket 01 · **D7** numeric zeros not written · **D8** correction files copied
verbatim behind a compat shim · **D9** constants extracted, not transcribed · **D10** the
prototype's SoD load-order defect fixed · **D11** collisions no longer displace · **D12** what
ships and what does not · **D13** `itemDropCorrections` is support data, not a Correction ·
**D14** the validator baseline · **D15** a second separator for list-valued fields.

The two most likely to want reversing are **D5** (lossless coordinates) and **D14** (the
baseline).
