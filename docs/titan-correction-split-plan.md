# Titan Correction split completion record

## Status

Implementation, full all-flavor validation, and GitHub issue closure are complete.

Questie PR [#7784](https://github.com/Questie/Questie/pull/7784) merged as:

```text
b1a6dc8c50a92ab88723a11556421d6462cdea49
```

QuestieDB is pinned to that commit. The reviewed accepted-record updates from the full matrix
were committed as `d2ac61d` (`test(corrections): refresh Titan split baselines`).

## Permanent design

These decisions are implemented and validated. They should not be reopened unless evidence
shows a defect:

1. Titan Reforged is a Dynamic Correction set over the Wrath database, like SoD over Era.
2. QuestieDB continues to ship one Wrath TOC metadata store. It does not add a separate Titan
   artifact.
3. Every provider from the four Titan entity files is Dynamic in QuestieDB.
4. The complete Titan set registers only when the active flavor is Wrath and the active season
   ID is `109`.
5. All four Titan source files are mandatory. Missing files are a hard port failure.
6. WotLK Correction files contain no Titan providers.
7. Titan quest tags and availability blacklists stay in Questie as consumer policy.
8. TBC and MoP content-phase functions stay excluded under ADR 0007.
9. No old-layout fallback, layout detection, compatibility shim, or conditional compatibility
   test remains.
10. `contractVersion` remains `1` because no released consumer depended on the old arrangement.

## Completed work

### Upstream pin and mechanical port

- [x] Advanced `QUESTIE_COMMIT` from
  `7615c03bd4294b046f3db66c2a2e97a3b49c39ef` to
  `b1a6dc8c50a92ab88723a11556421d6462cdea49`.
- [x] Verified the selected Questie commit contains the merged four-file Titan split.
- [x] Regenerated the schema against a clean Questie project directory. No committed schema
  changes were required.
- [x] Mechanically re-ported all Questie Correction files from the selected commit.
- [x] Regenerated `QuestieDB.toc`.
- [x] Added these committed provider files:
  - `src/corrections/Titan/titanReforgedQuestFixes.lua`
  - `src/corrections/Titan/titanReforgedNPCFixes.lua`
  - `src/corrections/Titan/titanReforgedItemFixes.lua`
  - `src/corrections/Titan/titanReforgedObjectFixes.lua`
- [x] Refreshed Correction files for the other expansions as required by the new Questie pin.
- [x] Kept the copied `src/derived/RamerDouglasPeucker.lua` faithful to the pin.

### Compatibility removal

- [x] Deleted the transitional `generator/correction-layout.lua` module.
- [x] Removed split-layout detection and partial-layout handling.
- [x] Removed old WotLK-embedded Titan provider support.
- [x] Removed per-function variant-gate machinery from runtime registration and manifest
  generation.
- [x] Removed conditional legacy-versus-split tests and counts.
- [x] Made the four Titan file declarations unconditional in `tools/port-corrections.lua`.
- [x] Confirmed no implementation reference to `LoadTitanReforgedFixes` remains.

### Permanent provider manifest

The generated manifest now declares exactly these providers in this order:

| File | Datatype | Dynamic providers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Titan/titanReforgedQuestFixes.lua` | Quest | `LoadQuests`, `LoadQuestOverrides` |
| `Titan/titanReforgedNPCFixes.lua` | Npc | `LoadNPCs`, `LoadNPCOverrides`, `LoadFactionNPCOverrides` |
| `Titan/titanReforgedItemFixes.lua` | Item | `LoadItems`, `LoadItemOverrides` |
| `Titan/titanReforgedObjectFixes.lua` | Object | `LoadObjects` |

All four entries use exact expansion membership:

```lua
expansions = { Wotlk = true }
```

This prevents season `109` from admitting Titan Corrections on Cata or Mists.

### Runtime behavior

- [x] Added file-level `Titan/` recognition in `src/corrections/register.lua`.
- [x] Required both Wrath and season `109`.
- [x] Kept the gate closed when flavor or `C_Seasons` information is unavailable.
- [x] Added a dedicated Titan load-order window after WotLK.
- [x] Registered all eight providers only after the complete file-level gate succeeds.
- [x] Preserved provider order so base rows load before overrides and faction overrides run last.
- [x] Kept SoD and Titan as independent gated Dynamic sets.

The permanent registration matrix is:

| Flavor | Season | Titan registers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wrath | 109 | yes |
| Wrath | none | no |
| Wrath | SoD | no |
| Vanilla | 109 | no |
| TBC | 109 | no |
| Cata | 109 | no |
| Mists | 109 | no |
| Wrath | missing seasons API | no |

### ADR 0007 ownership cleanup

- [x] Removed and excluded `QuestieTBCQuestFixes:LoadContentPhaseFixes`.
- [x] Removed and excluded `MopQuestFixes:LoadContentPhaseFixes`.
- [x] Removed and excluded `MopNpcFixes:LoadContentPhaseFixes`.
- [x] Removed and excluded `MopObjectFixes:LoadContentPhaseFixes`.
- [x] Kept existing Darkmoon ownership exclusions.
- [x] Updated the port exclusion helper to handle the ordinary comments attached to the
  upstream content-phase functions.
- [x] Kept Titan quest tags and availability blacklists out of QuestieDB.

### Tests

- [x] Assert exactly four Titan manifest files.
- [x] Assert the exact four paths, datatypes, expansion gates, and provider lists.
- [x] Assert exactly eight Titan Dynamic providers.
- [x] Assert the exact provider registration order and numeric load order.
- [x] Assert WotLK files expose only their ordinary faction providers.
- [x] Assert the retired per-function manifest field is absent.
- [x] Assert Source mode includes all four Titan files.
- [x] Assert only the Wrath Baked file list includes them.
- [x] Cover the complete registration matrix, including Cata and Mists season-109 rejection.
- [x] Cover representative public reads for all eight providers.
- [x] Assert representative Titan-only entities return true from `Exists`.
- [x] Assert representative Titan-only entities appear in composed enumeration.
- [x] Run those entity assertions in both Source and Baked mode.
- [x] Assert representative Titan-only entities remain absent from plain Wrath.
- [x] Keep Correction fidelity exclusions aligned with ADR 0007 ownership.

Representative provider probes currently cover:

| Provider | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| `LoadQuests` | Quest `93950` is `"A Message From The Stars"` |
| `LoadQuestOverrides` | Quest `6823` has level and required level `80` |
| `LoadNPCs` | NPC `257012` is `"Algalon the Observer"` |
| `LoadNPCOverrides` | NPC `14834` has minimum level `83` |
| `LoadFactionNPCOverrides` | Horde NPC `257012` uses Durotar |
| `LoadItems` | Item `264272` is `"Celestial Missive"` |
| `LoadItemOverrides` | Item `22734` drops from NPC `15172` |
| `LoadObjects` | Object `420002` is `"Blood Ritual Altar"` |

### CI and documentation

- [x] Added a Source TOC drift check before flavor Generation can mask it.
- [x] Added a Wrath runtime fixture so Baked Titan persona tests cannot silently skip in CI.
- [x] Updated the README re-sync process to include Source TOC regeneration.
- [x] Updated `CONTEXT.md` from a per-function gate term to a gated Dynamic set.
- [x] Kept issue #16's implementation and validation status synchronized in
  `docs/questie-handover.md`.
- [x] Marked the old per-function gate discussion in `CLAUDE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md` as historical.

### Reviewed data changes

- [x] Refreshed the Wrath Golden snapshot after reviewing:
  - 60 Titan-only entities removed from plain Wrath.
  - 30 inherited entities with changed composed hashes.
- [x] Removed the obsolete Wrath validator baseline entry for Titan quest `96211`.
- [x] Refreshed the remaining Golden snapshots after reviewing every changed entity:
  - Vanilla: 5 upstream Correction changes.
  - TBC: 26 upstream Correction changes.
  - Cata: 60 Titan-only entities removed and 32 inherited hashes changed.
  - Mists: 60 Titan-only entities removed and 31 inherited hashes changed.
- [x] Removed 67 Titan-derived accepted validator findings from both Cata and Mists.
- [x] Refreshed compiler baselines only for reviewed reductions:
  - TBC: 3 prerequisite-field divergences resolved by the active phase advancing to 3.
  - Wrath, Cata, and Mists: 11 health-field divergences removed with six Titan-only NPCs.
- [x] Confirmed all resulting Golden, validator, and compiler gates are clean.
