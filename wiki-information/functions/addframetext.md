## Title: addframetext

**Content:**
Appends a string to the debug frame text buffer for crash reporting.
`addframetext(text)`

**Parameters:**
- `text`
  - *string* - A string to log in the frame text buffer.

**Description:**
The frame text buffer is included as part of crash dumps generated by the client.
The frame text buffer is not cleared every frame. Instead, the client will keep accumulating strings into the buffer across multiple frames until it reaches a fixed capacity, at which point the buffer is then cleared.
