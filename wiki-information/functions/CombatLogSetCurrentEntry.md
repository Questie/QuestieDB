## Title: CombatLogSetCurrentEntry

**Content:**
Sets the currently selected combat log entry to the given value, to be retrieved using `CombatLogGetCurrentEntry()`.
`CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(index)`

**Parameters:**
- `index`
  - *number* - see details below
- `ignoreFilter`
  - *boolean* - set to true to ignore combat log filters

**Returns:**
- `isValidIndex`
  - *boolean* - will return false if the index does not exist in the combat log, but will still set the entry. Otherwise, returns true for valid indices.

**Description:**
Combat log indexing works a bit differently than standard Lua indexing. You can treat the combat log like a big table, with the oldest entries being placed at the beginning, and the newest entries at the end.
Unlike standard Lua tables, however, an index of 0 will set the entry to the most recent combat log entry. Additionally, you are also able to index the combat log backwards using negative values. For example, an index of -1 will return the second to last, or second most recent entry in the combat log.
See `CombatLogAdvanceEntry()` for details on traversing the combat log.

**Usage:**
```lua
-- Combat log indexing
CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(0, true); -- most recent entry, ignoring filters.
local newestEntry = {CombatLogGetCurrentEntry()};

CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(1, true); -- oldest entry, ignoring filters.
local oldestEntry = {CombatLogGetCurrentEntry()};

CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(-5, true); -- fifth newest entry, ignoring filters.
local fifthNewestEntry = {CombatLogGetCurrentEntry()};

CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(5, true); -- fifth oldest entry, ignoring filters.
local fifthOldestEntry = {CombatLogGetCurrentEntry()};
```

**Example Use Case:**
This function can be used in addons that analyze combat logs for specific events or patterns. For instance, an addon that tracks damage taken over time might use this function to set the current entry to various points in the combat log to gather data.

**Addons Using This Function:**
- **Recount**: A popular damage meter addon that tracks and displays damage, healing, and other combat-related statistics. It uses combat log entries to compile and display detailed combat data.
- **Details! Damage Meter**: Another comprehensive damage meter addon that provides in-depth analysis of combat logs to present detailed statistics on player performance.
