## Title: CancelShapeshiftForm

**Content:**
Cancels a shapeshift form.
`CancelShapeshiftForm()`

**Description:**
Shapeshifting cannot be cancelled through normal buff functions as that would allow insecure code to manipulate the macro conditional.
You can use `/cancelform` in a macro instead.
