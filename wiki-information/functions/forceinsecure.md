## Title: forceinsecure

**Content:**
Taints the current execution path.
`forceinsecure()`

**Description:**
The `forceinsecure` function is used to mark the current execution path as insecure. This is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's secure execution environment to indicate that certain actions or code paths should not be trusted or allowed to perform secure operations.

**Example Usage:**
This function is often used in the development of addons to ensure that certain code paths are marked as insecure, preventing them from performing actions that require a secure environment. For example, an addon might use `forceinsecure` to mark a function that handles user input as insecure to prevent it from being used to perform secure actions like casting spells or using items.

**Addons:**
Large addons like **ElvUI** and **WeakAuras** may use `forceinsecure` to manage secure and insecure code paths, ensuring that user interactions and custom scripts do not interfere with secure operations within the game. This helps maintain the integrity and security of the game's execution environment while allowing for extensive customization and functionality.
