## Title: C_ChatInfo.RegisterAddonMessagePrefix

**Content:**
Registers an addon message prefix to receive messages for that prefix.
`result = C_ChatInfo.RegisterAddonMessagePrefix(prefix)`

**Parameters:**
- `prefix`
  - *string* - The message prefix to register for delivery, at most 16 characters.

**Returns:**
- `result`
  - *Enum.RegisterAddonMessagePrefixResult* - Result code indicating if the prefix was registered successfully.

**Description:**
Registering prefixes does not persist after doing a /reload.
It's recommended to use the addon name as a prefix (provided it fits within the 16 byte limit) since it's more likely to be unique and other addon authors will have an easier time instead of figuring out what addon a certain abbreviation belongs to. See the Globe wut page for a list of addons that use this API to avoid collisions.

- `C_ChatInfo.IsAddonMessagePrefixRegistered()`
- `C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage()`

**Example Usage:**
This function can be used to register a custom prefix for an addon to communicate with other players using the same addon. For example, an addon named "MyAddon" could register the prefix "MyAddonMsg" to send and receive messages specific to that addon.

**Addons Using This API:**
Many large addons, such as "WeakAuras" and "DBM (Deadly Boss Mods)", use this API to handle inter-addon communication. They register specific prefixes to send data between users running the same addon, ensuring coordinated behavior and data sharing.
