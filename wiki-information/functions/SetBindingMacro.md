## Title: SetBindingMacro

**Content:**
Sets a binding to click the specified button object.
`ok = SetBindingMacro(key, macroName or macroId)`

**Parameters:**
- `("key", "macroName")` or `("key", macroId)`
  - `key`
    - *string* - Any binding string accepted by World of Warcraft. For example: `"ALT-CTRL-F"`, `"SHIFT-T"`, `"W"`, `"BUTTON4"`.
  - `macroName`
    - *string* - Name of the macro you wish to execute.
  - `macroId`
    - *number* - Index of the macro you wish to execute.

**Returns:**
- `ok`
  - *boolean* - 1 if the binding has been changed successfully, nil otherwise.

**Description:**
This function is functionally equivalent to the following statement.
`ok = SetBinding("key", "MACRO " .. macroName);`
A single binding can only be bound to a single command at a time, although multiple bindings may be bound to the same command. The Key Bindings UI will only show the first two bindings, but there is no limit to the number of keys that can be used for the same command.
You must use SetBinding to unbind a key.

**Reference:**
- `SetBinding`

**Example Usage:**
```lua
-- Bind the "SHIFT-T" key to a macro named "MyMacro"
local success = SetBindingMacro("SHIFT-T", "MyMacro")
if success then
    print("Binding set successfully!")
else
    print("Failed to set binding.")
end
```
