## Title: SetTrainerServiceTypeFilter

**Content:**
Sets the status of a skill filter in the trainer window.
`SetTrainerServiceTypeFilter(type, status)`

**Parameters:**
- `type`
  - *string* - filter to set the status for:
    - `"available"` (can learn)
    - `"unavailable"` (can't learn)
    - `"used"` (already known)
- `status`
  - *Flag* - 1 to show, 0 to hide items matching the specified filter. (Note that this is likely a bug as GetTrainerServiceTypeFilter returns a boolean now.)
- `exclusive`
  - *?* - ?

**Example Usage:**
```lua
-- Show only the skills that are available to learn
SetTrainerServiceTypeFilter("available", 1)
-- Hide the skills that are already known
SetTrainerServiceTypeFilter("used", 0)
```

**Description:**
This function is used to control the visibility of different types of skills in the trainer window. It allows you to filter skills based on whether they are available to learn, unavailable, or already known. This can be particularly useful for customizing the trainer interface to show only relevant skills.

**Usage in Addons:**
Large addons like TradeSkillMaster (TSM) may use this function to filter out skills that are not relevant to the user, thereby providing a cleaner and more focused interface. For example, TSM might hide skills that are already known to avoid cluttering the trainer window.
