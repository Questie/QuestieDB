## Title: SetBindingClick

**Content:**
Sets a binding to click the specified Button widget.
`ok = SetBindingClick(key, buttonName)`

**Parameters:**
- `key`
  - *string* - Any binding string accepted by World of Warcraft. For example: "ALT-CTRL-F", "SHIFT-T", "W", "BUTTON4".
- `buttonName`
  - *string* - Name of the button you wish to click.
- `button`
  - *string* - Value of the button argument you wish to pass to the OnClick handler with the click; "LeftButton" by default.

**Returns:**
- `ok`
  - *boolean* - 1 if the binding has been changed successfully, nil otherwise.

**Description:**
This function is functionally equivalent to the following statement.
`ok = SetBinding("key", "CLICK " .. buttonName .. (button and (":" .. button) or ""));`
A single binding can only be bound to a single command at a time, although multiple bindings may be bound to the same command. The Key Bindings UI will only show the first two bindings, but there is no limit to the number of keys that can be used for the same command.
You must use SetBinding to unbind a key.

**Reference:**
`SetBinding`

**Example Usage:**
```lua
-- Bind the "F" key to click a button named "MyButton"
SetBindingClick("F", "MyButton")

-- Bind the "SHIFT-G" key to click a button named "AnotherButton" with the right mouse button
SetBindingClick("SHIFT-G", "AnotherButton", "RightButton")
```

**Addons Using This Function:**
Many large addons, such as Bartender4 and ElvUI, use `SetBindingClick` to allow users to customize their key bindings for various UI elements and actions. This function is essential for creating flexible and user-friendly interfaces where players can bind keys to specific buttons or actions dynamically.
