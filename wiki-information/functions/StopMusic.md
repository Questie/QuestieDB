## Title: StopMusic

**Content:**
Stops the currently playing music.
`StopMusic()`

**Description:**
This does not affect the built-in zone music, only music files that are played with `PlayMusic`.
Before Patch 2.2, this function would fade the currently playing music out. After Patch 2.2, it stops it immediately without a fade.
