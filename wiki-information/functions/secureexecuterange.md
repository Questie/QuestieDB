## Title: secureexecuterange

**Content:**
Calls a function for each pair within a table without propagating taint to the caller.
`secureexecuterange(tbl, func, ...)`

**Parameters:**
- `tbl`
  - *table* - The table to be traversed.
- `func`
  - *function* - The function to be called for each pair.
- `...`
  - Additional arguments to supply to the invoked function.

**Description:**
The supplied function will be called with the key and value of each pair within the table as the first two arguments, followed by any additional user-supplied arguments.

Execution of the supplied function will be tainted in the following scenarios:
- If the initial state of execution was insecure.
- If the table pair currently being processed was insecurely inserted.
- If the supplied function was created by insecure code.

If execution is tainted during the processing of a single pair, the taint does not propagate to the processing of any remaining pairs within the supplied table.

Errors that occur during the execution of the supplied function are discarded, and do not propagate to the caller. Additionally, errors do not prevent the function from being called for all remaining pairs within the supplied table so as to prevent insecure code from potentially changing the flow of execution.

**Example Implementation:**
The implementation of this function would, if not provided natively by the client, be effectively similar to the snippet below. This example aims to demonstrate how error handling and taint is processed with regards to individual pairs within the table.

```lua
local function secureexecutenext(tbl, prev, func, ...)
  local key, value = next(tbl, prev)
  if key ~= nil then
    pcall(func, key, value, ...) -- Errors are silently discarded!
  end
  return key
end

function secureexecuterange(tbl, func, ...)
  local key = nil
  repeat
    key = securecallfunction(secureexecutenext, tbl, key, func, ...)
  until key == nil
end
```

**Example Usage:**
This function can be used in scenarios where you need to iterate over a table and perform operations on each key-value pair without risking taint propagation or error interruption. For instance, it can be used in secure environment setups where maintaining the integrity of the execution state is crucial.

**Addons Usage:**
Large addons that handle secure execution of code, such as those managing UI elements or secure templates, might use this function to ensure that their operations do not inadvertently taint the global execution environment. For example, addons like ElvUI or Bartender4, which deal with secure handling of action bars and UI elements, could leverage this function to safely iterate over configuration tables.
