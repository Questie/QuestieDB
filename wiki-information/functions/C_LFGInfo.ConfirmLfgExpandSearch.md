`C_LFGInfo.ConfirmLfgExpandSearch()`

**Description:**
This function is used to confirm the expansion of the search radius for the Looking For Group (LFG) system. When the LFG system cannot find a match within the initial search parameters, it may prompt the user to expand the search to include a wider range of potential matches. This function confirms that action.

**Example Usage:**
An addon might use this function to automatically confirm the expansion of the search radius, ensuring that the player finds a group more quickly without manual intervention.

**Addons:**
Large addons like "DBM (Deadly Boss Mods)" or "ElvUI" might use this function to enhance the LFG experience by automating certain aspects of the group-finding process.
